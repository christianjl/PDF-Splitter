 `Split Into Individual Files` - Creates a new folder in the same location as the `File Location`. The folder name is the same as the specified PDF file with 'Split Files' appended. If the folder already exists, an unique number will be appended to prevent overwriting.
 
 `New File from Pages` - A new PDF file is created from the entered page ranges in the same location as the `File Location`. The file name is the same as the specified PDF file with '(Edited)' appended. If the file already exists, an unique number will be appended to prevent overwriting. 
 
 If `New File Name` is specified, the new PDF will be created with the entered name.
